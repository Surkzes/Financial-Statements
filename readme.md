# Basic Financial Statements
Pulls financial data straight from Yahoo Finances webpages, so it doesn't need a paid API,
  but it won't be able to retrieve data further than four years back
 
 ## Returns a Pandas DataFrame for the following:
 * Income Statement
 * Balance Sheet
 * Statement of Cash Flows
